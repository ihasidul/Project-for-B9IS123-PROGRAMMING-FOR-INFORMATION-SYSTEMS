# Project Inspiration

## Company Description

CrowdFarming is a European platform that connects consumers directly with organic farmers, enabling them to buy seasonal produce or adopt trees and animals to receive their harvests. It eliminates intermediaries, allowing farmers to set fair prices while reducing food waste and environmental impact. The platform supports farmers with logistics, packaging, and customer service, promoting sustainable and transparent agriculture across Europe.

## My Project Idea

In my project, I want to create a platform where farmers can list their products for sale and general consumers can buy directly from the farmers. An additional feature will be that Other businesses and small stores can also post for their needs, and the platform will gather products from multiple farmers to serve the business's larger needs.
